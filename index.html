       The IRT Flushing Line
    </h2>
    <p>
       Out of the entire A division (numbered lines) of NYCT, the IRT Flushing Line,
       represented by the purple service emblem and the number seven, is the
       youngest IRT line. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company created the line
       in 1915-1928 as a part of a significant moment in NYC transit history known
       as the Dual Contracts, which was an agreement made by the Interborough Rapid
       Transit Company, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the city to extend
       and build new subway lines in Brooklyn and Queens.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a part of the Flushing actually pre-dates the IRT. The Steinway Tunnel
      under the East River was bult in 1885 by the East River Tunnel Railroad, which
      abandoned the plan for the tunnel after the tunnels electrification in the early
      1900s. It was then when the IRT took over and extended the tunnel to Hunters
      Point Avenue in 1915. The following year, the line was brought onto an elevated
      structure at the Queensboro Plaza station, which was soon to be the prized jewel of Queens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Dual Contracts, both the IRT, and the reformed Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit
      Company from the ruins of the BMT, created the Flushing and Astoria Lines respectively.
      Queensboro Plaza became a mega-complex, with trains coming from the Steinway Tunnel,
      BMT 59th Street Tunnels, and the IRT's Second Avenue Elevated over the Queensborough bridge, and outwards
      onto the IRT's Flushing Line or the IRT's Astoria Line. The BMT ran a shuttle over their own
      Astoria line directly parallel to the IRT. In the plan for the complex, there was also a plan
      for a BMT Crosstown line to connect to their Jamaica Elevated at the entrance of the
      Williamsburg Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range 1925-1927 was huge for the IRT Flushing line. In the same range,
      the IRT Astoria Line was converted for BMT use, ending the BMT shuttle service
      and starting BMT service from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard onto points south in Brooklyn.
      At the same time, points east of Queenosboro Plaza into the main street of
      Flushing was completed. Additionally, the line was extended from Grand Central onto
      Fifth Avenue in 1926, and to Times Square in 1927. This was just in time seeing that
      the World's Fair would come to Corona Park just a little more than ten years later.
    </p>
    <p>
       Presently, with the IRT Flushing Line running from 34th Street-Hudson Yards to
       Flushing-Main Street, the 7 line has earned the name of the "International Express"
       for serving multiple high density and diverse neighborhoods in succession, including
       Midtown, Sunnyside, Jackson Heights, Mets-Willets Point, and Flushing. Even with
       the implementation of Communications Based Train Control, or CBTC on the line
       along with Automatic Train Operation in 2019, allowing the line to see trains every
       single minute during rush hours pre-pandemic, 7 trains were still filled to capacity
       and are pretty much at their limit. Thus, I introduce the LaGuardia AirTrain plan.

    <h2>
        The LaGuardia AirTrain Plan
    </h2>
    <p>
        Headed by Governor Andrew Cuomo and the Port Authority of New York and New
        Jersey, the LGA AirTrain Plan is a proposal to connect LaGuardia airport
        to a designated area in Queens for greater accessibility. In a study released
        on how the LGA Airtrain in early January, it was determined that out of Jackson Heights
        and Mets-Willet's Point, the AirTrain will be built on Mets-Willet's Point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new AirTrain will be similar in structure to the already existing JFK Airport,
        which currently connects all the terminals of JFK Internation Airport and also features
        two branches, one to Howard Beach in connetion to the IND (Independent Subway, the third
        company out of three founding companies that made up the subway other than the IRT and the BMT)
        Rockaway Line <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/A_Train_%281967-1987%29.svg/768px-A_Train_%281967-1987%29.svg.png"

        instead is classified simply as a people mover. The trains are handled entirely by computers, such that
        no operators of any sort are on the train itself. In the case of a power blackout, the AirTrain has
        five emergency power generators to keep it running.

    <h2>
        The Issue of the LGA AirTrain
    </h2>
    <p>
        As you may have figured out by the title of this webpage, I have a bone to
        pick with the alignment of the LGA AirTrain that the developers have chosen, and it has to <!DOCTYPE html>
        with the IRT Flushing Line.
    </p>
    <p>
        For context on the two alignments, Jackson Heights was a potential candidate because of the connections it has,
        for which it is a major transfer point for the IRT Flushing Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Both of these
        lines are a part of New York City Transit, or in other words the subway system. Similarly, Mets-Willets point
        was also a candidate because of it's connections, it being the IRT Flushing Line, and the LIRR Port Washington Branch.
        One of these connections is a subway line, and the other is a commuter railroad. According to the website given above
        for the thinking behind the superiority of Mets-Willets Point to Jackson Heights, the travel time goes as follows.
    </p>
    <img src="http://anewlga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Proposed-airtrain-new-lga-illustrative-need.jpg" width="600" height="400">
    <p>
        Notice that the picture illustrates a predicted travel time of thirty minutes or less using the <b>Long Island Rail Road</b>.
        If we only consider the LIRR Port Washington Branch, we can look at the areas that it serves to see who it will benefit. In
        the City Terminal Zone, the branch connects to New York Pennsylvania Station, and will soon connect to Grand Central Terminal.
        To the east we have...Port Washington, along with Flushing as a major station. The Port Washington Branch is the only LIRR Branch that doesn't connect to Jamaica.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well lets look at the IRT Flushing Line. You will see that the IRT Flushing Line also serves
        NY Penn, GCT, and Flushing! To know which service riders would use more, we can just look at the price
        and the composition of the branches. The subway has a base fare of $2.75, while the LIRR from Penn to
        Willets is about $10, making the 7 better. For the composition, the IRT already has headways of seven minutes.
        As for the Port Washington Branch, it is single tracked in Long Island, meaning that both directions are using one track
        instead of two. This severely impacts the frequently at which Port Washington trains can run, up to about every 20
        to 30 minutes. Therefore, the 7 train would come more frequently. Resultantly, more people would probably use the IRT
        Flushing Line compared to the LIRR Port Washington Branch, creating a loophole in the current alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The consequences of having the AirTrain serve the IRT Flushing Line without a suffcient service to back the flushing line up?
        I think this political cartoon summarizes the situation pretty accurately.
    </p>
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/swe2c09g3w161.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b8518688a65ce893806dd408434b8d2cb64831f6" width="400" height="600">
    <p>
        The IRT Flushing Line already serves so many high density residental neighborhoods, and the
        LGA AirTrain is bound to have heaps of passengers. The Flushing Line cannot handle the extra
        passengers at this rate. At least with the Jackson Heights alignment, the riders would have been split between the Flushing Line and the Queens Boulevard Line (though
        even this is not a great solution because the Queens Boulevard Line is also at capacity and is a major source of overcrowding, but CBTC coming to line will
        allow for more trains being run on it to somewhat solve the problem).
        As it already is, the IRT Flushing Line is barely able to serve
        everything that it serves already. So what is the solution? I and the people I have asked from the Stuyvesant
        Transit and Urbanism Association along with Brooklyn Tech's counterpart propose the extension of the
        BMT Astoria Line. Not only is the line closer to Manhattan than the IRT Flushing Line alignment, but the line
        is far from capacity. It will also be the best for riders in terms of fares with a direct subway connection
        to LaGuardia Airport. All we need to do is extend the N line by less than five blocks to reach
        LaGuardia.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that, I make my final point against this AirTrain plan. The Astoria Line will be
        better in terms of fares and travel time. In addition, riders coming from Jamaica and the Rockaways will still
        have access to the Q70 bus service, and riders from Uptown and Metro-North will continue to have the M60.
        As such, coverage will be practically the entirely of Long Island, Queens, and Brooklyn, with quickly access to Manhattan,
        the Bronx, and even Staten Island. Best of all, an extension of the Astoria Line will not gridlock the system, saving
        the IRT Flushing Line from the impending doom waiting for it right around the corner.
