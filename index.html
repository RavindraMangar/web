    <h2>
      The Origins of the H system
    </h2>
    <p>
       Created in the year 1900, the Interborough Rapid Transit company, or
         IRT, was created to be in charge of the city's first ever subway line,
         which ran from City Hall on the Lower East Side to 145th Street on
         Manhattan's Upper West Side. The line switched from the east side of
         Manhattan to the west side via 42nd street, essentially serving as the
         template for the IND Lexington, Broadway, and 42nd Street Lines. It
         should be noted that elevated lines did predate this invention, as
         discussed in the BRT section. This was the just first <b>underground</b> people
         mover system in New York City.

      Less than a year after the 1904 subway opened, the IRT opened it's connection
      for 110th street into Harlem and the Bronx, which is used by present day 2 and 3 trains.
      Additionally, the originally subway's terminus at 145th street was also
      extended into the Bronx at 242nd Street, which is currently used by the 1 train.
      Looking downwards, a seventh avenue line was opened in 1908 that connected
      42nd Street to a new loop terminal at South Ferry. The original subway was also
      extended from City Hall to the South Ferry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the completion of the Lexington Avenue line, or the line that runs on
      the Upper East Side by the IRT along with a new set of tunnels into Brooklyn,
      the IRT proceeded to rearrange it's services. A "H" system of services
      resulted, where trains would either run on the IRT Seventh Avenue Line onto
      the Broadway Line into the Bronx, or trains would run on the Lexington avenue
      line. In both cases, the subways run on elevated tracks in the Bronx,
      connecting the new subway to the pre-existing Ninth, Sixth, Third, and Second
      Avenue elevated railroads. Equally as important, the 42nd street connection
      between the Seventh Avenue and Lexington lines was converted into the 42nd
      Street shuttle.

      Diagram of the South Ferry Loop illustrating that the loop is composed of two
      loops. The inner loop was served by Lexington Avenue trains, but is currently
      used by 5 trains to turn around. The outer loop was used by Seventh Avenue
      trains but was abandoned in 2017 in favor of the new South Ferry station
      on the lower level, served by the 1 train (some 5 trains terminate
      at Bowling Green rush hours). When the station was in use, the inner and outer
      platforms operated independently (no transfer).

       Image of the Old South Ferry Station's outer loop. Notice the sections of
       platform that seem detached from the rest of the platform by extending out
       to the train. These are known as gap extenders, and are used when the station
       exists on a curve that creates a gap in larger subway cars (to be discussed later).
       Gap fillers can be retracted or extended, but it is simply more faster to have
       non curved stations, hence the existence of new City Hall and South Ferry
       stations. The only station in the system to still have gap fillers is the
       14th Street-Union Square station on the IRT Lexington Line platforms.
